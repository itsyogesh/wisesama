With over $3 billion lost to crypto crime in the first half of 2025 alone, protecting your digital assets has never been more important. This comprehensive checklist will help you stay safe.

## Wallet Security

### Hardware Wallets
- Store significant holdings on hardware wallets
- Buy directly from manufacturers (never secondhand)
- Keep firmware updated
- Store recovery phrases offline in multiple secure locations

### Software Wallets
- Use reputable, open-source wallets
- Enable all available security features
- Never store large amounts in hot wallets
- Regularly check for and install updates

## Seed Phrase Protection

Your seed phrase is the master key to your crypto. Protect it like your life depends on it:

- **Never store digitally** - No photos, no cloud storage, no password managers
- **Never share with anyone** - No legitimate service will ever ask for it
- **Use metal backup** - Paper can burn or get water damaged
- **Consider splitting** - Store parts in different secure locations
- **Test your backup** - Verify you can recover before you need to

## Transaction Security

Before sending any transaction:

1. **Verify the address** - Use tools like Wisesama to check if an address is associated with scams
2. **Double-check amounts** - Especially the number of zeros
3. **Send a test transaction** - For large amounts, send a small test first
4. **Verify on the device** - If using a hardware wallet, confirm on the device screen

## Phishing Prevention

With AI-powered phishing up 1,633% in 2025:

- **Bookmark official sites** - Never click links in emails or messages
- **Verify URLs carefully** - Scammers use similar-looking domains
- **Be skeptical of urgency** - Legitimate services don't pressure you
- **Use hardware keys** - They're phishing-resistant
- **Enable 2FA everywhere** - But avoid SMS-based 2FA when possible

## Social Engineering Defense

The most sophisticated attacks target humans, not technology:

- **No legitimate support will DM you first**
- **No real giveaway requires you to send crypto first**
- **No emergency requires you to act in the next 5 minutes**
- **When in doubt, verify through official channels**

## Network Security

- Use a VPN on public networks
- Keep your devices updated
- Use a dedicated device for crypto if possible
- Be cautious of browser extensions

## The Wisesama Way

Tools like Wisesama help you verify:
- **Addresses** - Check if they're associated with known scams
- **URLs** - Verify websites aren't phishing sites
- **Social profiles** - Confirm identities before trusting

## Quick Reference Checklist

- [ ] Using hardware wallet for main holdings
- [ ] Seed phrase stored offline in multiple locations
- [ ] 2FA enabled on all exchanges and services
- [ ] Bookmarks for all crypto sites (no clicking links)
- [ ] Test transaction habit for large transfers
- [ ] Regular security updates on all devices
- [ ] Address verification before every transaction

Stay safe out there. The crypto space is full of opportunity, but also full of people trying to take advantage. A few minutes of verification can save you from devastating losses.
